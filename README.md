# Object Detection and Tracking Workflow Documentation

## **Introduction**
Object detection and tracking are key components in computer vision used to identify and monitor objects in videos or image sequences. The codes provided demonstrate different methods for these tasks, including YOLO-based detection, DeepSORT tracking, and feature-based object tracking using ORB descriptors.

This documentation outlines the concepts and steps involved, focusing on the provided workflows.

# **1. Basics of Object Detection and Tracking**

## **Object Detection:**
Object detection locates and classifies objects in an image or video frame. It outputs bounding boxes and labels around the identified objects.

- **Example Approaches:**
  - **YOLO (You Only Look Once):** A deep learning method that divides an image into grids and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.
  - **Edge Detection:** Uses gradients and filtering techniques to locate object boundaries.
  - **Feature Matching:** Identifies keypoints and patterns for object recognition.

## **Object Tracking:**
Object tracking monitors the movement of detected objects across frames in a video. It assigns a unique ID to each object and updates its position in subsequent frames.

- **DeepSORT:** Tracks objects by associating detections in consecutive frames using appearance and motion information.
- **ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF):** Matches features based on descriptors and tracks them between frames.

# **2. Workflow 1: DeepSORT Tracking with YOLO**

### **Purpose:**
This workflow detects and tracks objects using YOLO for detection and DeepSORT for tracking. The user can click on an object to specifically track its movement, saving the positional data to a CSV file.

### **Key Steps:**
1. **Workflow Initialization:**
   - Import necessary libraries (cv2, ikomia).
   - Define input and output paths for the video.
   - Create a workflow with YOLO for detection and DeepSORT for tracking.

2. **Parameter Configuration:**
   - Set detection thresholds and categories for tracking.
   - Initialize variables for storing selected object IDs and positions.

3. **Click Event Handling:**
   - Detect mouse clicks on an object to enable focused tracking.

4. **Object Tracking:**
   - Identify objects in each frame and match them based on the DeepSORT algorithm.
   - Draw bounding boxes around selected objects.

5. **Data Logging:**
   - Save object positions (frame number, X, Y coordinates) to a CSV file.

6. **Video Output:**
   - Display processed frames and save the output as a new video.

### **Applications:**
- Traffic monitoring.
- Tracking vehicles or pedestrians.
- Analyzing object movements in surveillance systems.

# **3. Workflow 2: Edge Detection Pipeline**

### **Purpose:**
This pipeline demonstrates edge detection using a series of image processing techniques. Edge detection helps identify object boundaries, which are crucial for detection and tracking algorithms.

### **Key Steps:**
1. **Noise Reduction:**
   - Apply Gaussian Blur to smooth the image and reduce noise.

2. **Gradient Calculation:**
   - Use Sobel filters to compute gradients along the X and Y directions.

3. **Non-Maximum Suppression:**
   - Thin the edges by keeping only the pixels with the highest gradient values in their neighborhoods.

4. **Double Thresholding:**
   - Classify pixels as strong or weak edges based on intensity thresholds.

5. **Edge Tracking by Hysteresis:**
   - Connect weak edges to strong edges, ensuring continuity of detected edges.

6. **Result Visualization:**
   - Display the final edge map and compare it with Canny edge detection.

### **Applications:**
- Preprocessing for object detection algorithms.
- Feature extraction for recognition tasks.
- Boundary detection in medical imaging.

# **4. Workflow 3: ORB-Based Feature Tracking**

### **Purpose:**
This workflow tracks objects based on features extracted using ORB descriptors and matches them across frames.

### **Key Steps:**
1. **Feature Detection with ORB:**
   - Detect keypoints and compute descriptors for regions identified as objects.

2. **Contour Filtering:**
   - Extract contours based on size, shape, and solidity to isolate objects of interest.

3. **Feature Matching with BFMatcher:**
   - Match descriptors between frames using Brute-Force Matching.
   - Filter matches based on distance thresholds for accuracy.

4. **Bounding Box Tracking:**
   - Update bounding boxes around objects and visualize matches with lines.

5. **Data Logging:**
   - Save frame details, object IDs, and matching statistics to a CSV file.

### **Applications:**
- Object tracking in dynamic environments.
- Feature-based tracking in low-light conditions.
- Vehicle tracking for autonomous systems.
